Question 1
Machine learning is suited to solve which of the following tasks? (Select all that apply.)


**Churn Analysis**

Reporting

**Natural Language Processing**

**Image Recognition**

**Financial Forecasting**

**Fraud Detection**

**A/B Testing**

Question 2
Is a model that is 99% accurate at predicting breast cancer a good model?


Likely no because there are too many false positives

**Likely no because there are not many cases of cancer in a general population**

Likely yes because this is generally a high score

Likely yes because it accounts for false negatives and we'd want to make sure we catch every case of cancer

Question 3
What is an appropriate baseline model to compare a machine learning solution to?

**The average of the dataset**

Zero

The minimum value of the dataset


Question 4
What is Machine Learning? (Select all that apply.)


Statistical moments calculated against a dataset

Hand-coded logic

**Learning patterns in your data without being explicitly programmed**

**A function that maps features to an output**


Question 5
(Fill in the blanks with the appropriate answer below.)

Predicting whether a website user is fraudulent or not is an example of _________ machine learning. It is a __________ task.


**supervised, classification**

unsupervised, classification

unsupervised, regression

supervised, regression


Question 6
(Fill in the blanks with the appropriate answer below.)

Grouping similar users together based on past activity is an example of _________ machine learning. It is a _________ task.

**unsupervised, clustering**

unsupervised, classification

supervised, classification

supervised, clustering


Question 7
Predicting the next quarter of a company's earnings is an example of...


Reinforcement

Classification

**Regression**

Semi-supervised

Clustering


Question 8
Why do we want to perform a train/test split before we train a machine learning model? (Select all that apply.)


**To keep the model from "overfitting" where it memorizes the data it has seen**

To calculate a baseline model

To give us subsets of our data so we can compare a model trained on one versus the model trained on the other

**To evaluate how our model performs on unseen data**


Question 9
What is a linear regression model learning about your data?


The value of the closest points to the one you're trying to predict

**The formula for the line of best fit**

The best split points in a decision tree

The average of the data


Question 10
How do you define a custom function not already part of core Spark?


You can't write your own functions in Spark

**With a User-Defined Function**

By extending the open source code base
